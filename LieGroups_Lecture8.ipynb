    "- Understanding **group actions on feature maps** (like scalar or vector fields) is crucial for defining equivariant operations (like convolutions).\n",
    "- **Spherical CNNs**, used in areas like astrophysics (CMB analysis), molecular modeling, and 360Â° vision, are a prime example of G-CNNs on the homogeneous space $S^2$.\n",

    "# Summary & Further Exploration\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored key concepts underlying equivariant neural networks on homogeneous spaces, using the sphere $S^2 \\cong SO(3)/SO(2)$ as our primary example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Homogeneous Space Representation**: Visualized how $S^2$ arises as the orbit of a point under the $SO(3)$ action ($S^2 = SO(3)/SO(2)$).\n",
    "2.  **Associated Bundles & Equivariant Maps**: Showed how tangent vector fields on $S^2$ (sections of the tangent bundle $TS^2$) can be understood through the lens of associated bundles ($SO(3) \\times_{SO(2)} \\mathbb{R}^2$) and $H$-equivariant maps ($H=SO(2)$).\n",
    "3.  **Group Action on Fields**: Demonstrated the \"push-pull\" action of $SO(3)$ on vector fields, illustrating the core idea of equivariance for feature maps.\n",
    "4.  **Harmonic Analysis**: Introduced spherical harmonics $Y_l^m$ as an equivariant basis for functions on $S^2$, forming irreducible representations of $SO(3)$.\n",
    "5.  **Harmonic Representation**: Showed how signals on the sphere can be represented by a vector of their harmonic coefficients $\\hat{f}_{lm}$.\n",
    "6.  **Linear Equivariant Maps & Schur's Lemma**: Demonstrated that linear SO(3)-equivariant maps acting on harmonic coefficients must be block-diagonal, with each block being a scalar multiple of the identity $(\\mathbf{\\Psi})_{lm, l'm'} = \\delta_{ll'} \\delta_{mm'} \\hat{\\psi}_l$.\n",
    "7.  **Convolution Equivalence**: Explicitly verified Theorem 3.1 (Cohen et al., 2019), showing that such a linear equivariant map is equivalent to performing spherical convolution in the harmonic domain with filter coefficients $\\hat{\\kappa}_l = \\hat{\\psi}_l$.\n",
    "8.  **Practical Implementation**: Used the `e3nn` library to construct an SO(3)-equivariant linear layer and numerically verified its equivariance property, demonstrating how libraries abstract the underlying theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a clear path from the geometric foundations of homogeneous spaces and group actions to the practical construction of equivariant neural networks, highlighting the crucial role of representation theory (spherical harmonics, Schur's lemma) in linking symmetry constraints to the form of learnable layers (convolution).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Explore other homogeneous spaces (e.g., hyperbolic space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SO(2)$) and the corresponding group actions and harmonic bases.\n",
    "- Implement a more complete spherical convolution using libraries like `e3nn`'s `o3.Convolution`.\n",
    "- Investigate different types of feature maps (e.g., higher-order tensors) and their corresponding associated bundles and representations (`Irreps` in `e3nn`).\n",
    "- Study different G-CNN architectures built using these equivariant layers for specific applications (e.g., point clouds, molecular data, physics simulations)."
